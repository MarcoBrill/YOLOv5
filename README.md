# Computer Vision Workflow for Object Detection in Videos

This repository contains a Python script to detect multiple objects in videos using the YOLOv5 model. The script processes an input video, detects objects in each frame, and saves the output video with bounding boxes around the detected objects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 (via `torch.hub`)

## Inputs and Outputs
Input: A video file (e.g., input_video.mp4) containing the frames to be processed.
Output: A video file (e.g., output_video.mp4) with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.

## How It Works
1. The script uses the YOLOv5 model to detect objects in each frame of the input video.
2. It draws bounding boxes around detected objects and saves the processed frames to an output video.
3. The `README.md` file provides clear instructions for setting up and running the workflow.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-video.git
   cd object-detection-video
